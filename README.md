###Unusual/Interesting Features
N/A 

###Hardest part of the assignment
Retrieving the process table, specifically using the function sys_vircopy()

###Any additional comments regarding the assignment
First intermediate task took WAY too long; information & tutorials were insufficient

###How we modified Minix to retrieve a copy of the process table and how you implemented SPN scheduling
1. *PROCESS TABLE:*
  First, we implemented a system call to the PM server. We did this by following the tutorial given to us in the project pdf and on piazza. We neglected doing the library file and instead called the system call directly within our program. We then implemented a task call to the schedule server using a similar process that was used for creating the system call. We defined a new consant for the switch statement in main.c for the scheduling server; inside this case statement we called OSSendPTab where we retrieved the process table via the predefined kernel call and attempted to copy it up to the user level using sys_vircopy(). This is where we were unable to complete the first intermediate due to complications and decided to turn the first intermediate as is.

2. *SPN SCHEDULING:*
	Inside OSSendPTab we got the endpoints and other process information for the processes generated by the proc function and stored them in the sjf-struct array. Inside schedule.c, we modified the schedule_process function to calculate the predicted burst time of the process that has been preempted or blocked. We then sorted the burst times and selected the one with the shortest predicted burst time. We used the kernel call qptab to dequeue and enqueue this process. We modificed com.c inside the OSPEX directory to run the simulation without the GUI allowing printf statements at the server level to be displayed in the console. We then printed the predicted burst times for all the simulated processes and printed the index of the process that we chose.

###Description of how team proved that SPN was implemented
	##(see SCREENSHOTS folders)
		**NOTE** *We forgot to adjust the index so proc1 is displayed as proc0 JUST in the screenshots and the offset propogates through the functions*
		- Within the screenshots, the list of predicted burst times is displayed for a certain step within the simulation. We also indicate which process was chose to be dequeued and enqueued within the kernel
